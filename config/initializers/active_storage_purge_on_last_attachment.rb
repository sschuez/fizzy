# Fizzy-specific override: ActiveStorage's default purge path uses `delete`,
# which skips attachment callbacks. We need `destroy` so storage ledger detaches
# are recorded and reused blobs (ActionText embeds) aren't purged until the
# last attachment is gone. Keep this local to Fizzy; it's not a Rails default.
